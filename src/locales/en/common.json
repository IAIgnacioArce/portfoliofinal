          "description": "In this project, I was the Leader of the Data Analytics area, coordinating a team of 7 members specialized in data analysis. We faced the challenge of cleaning and transforming large volumes of data to implement a machine learning model that predicts conversion rates and the reach of advertising campaigns based on their characteristics. We used tools like Python and Scikit-learn for the model, which was deployed on Streamlit. Additionally, we conducted a comparative analysis between predictions and actual campaign results, generating key recommendations for strategic decision-making. This effort was part of the development of CEREM, a CRM that centralizes all functions into a single platform and uses artificial intelligence to simplify management. The system integrates with Google Calendar and Google Keep for efficient time and marketing task management.",
